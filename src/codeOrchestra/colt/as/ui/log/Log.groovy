FocusModel classes. A ListView has at most one instance of each of these classes, available from selectionModel and focusModel properties respectively. Whilst it is possible to use this API to set a new selection model, in most circumstances this is not necessary - the default selection and focus models should work in most circumstances. The default SelectionModel used when instantiating a ListView is an implementation of the MultipleSelectionModel abstract class. However, as noted in the API documentation for the selectionMode property, the default value is SelectionMode.SINGLE. To enable multiple selection in a default ListView instance, it is therefore necessary to do the following: listView.getSelectionModel().setSelectionMode(SelectionMode.MULTIPLE);""", 10, ""),
